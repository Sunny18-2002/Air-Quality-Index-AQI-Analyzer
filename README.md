# Air-Quality-Index-AQI-Analyzer
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a vital tool used to assess the quality of the air we breathe based on various pollutants present in the atmosphere. It categorizes air quality into six distinct buckets, each with a specific range of AQI values, associated symptoms, potential diseases, and recommended precautions.

    Good (0-50):
        AQI in this range indicates excellent air quality.
        No significant symptoms expected.
        Lower risk of respiratory diseases.
        No specific precautions required, enjoy outdoor activities.

    Satisfactory (51-100):
        Air quality is acceptable, though slight pollution may be present.
        Minor irritations for sensitive individuals.
        Precautions: Sensitive individuals should limit outdoor exposure.

    Moderate (101-200):
        Moderate air quality with increased pollutants.
        Respiratory discomfort for some.
        Precautions: Reduce outdoor activities, wear masks if necessary.

    Poor (201-300):
        Poor air quality with visible pollutants.
        Increased risk of respiratory illnesses.
        Precautions: Minimize outdoor exposure, wear masks, and use air purifiers indoors.

    Very Poor (301-400):
        Very poor air quality, hazardous to health.
        Severe respiratory symptoms.
        Precautions: Stay indoors, wear masks, and use air purifiers.

    Severe (401-2500):
        Extremely severe air pollution, life-threatening.
        Immediate health risks.
        Precautions: Stay indoors, use high-efficiency masks, and seek medical attention if needed.

Monitoring the AQI and following recommended precautions can help individuals safeguard their health and make informed decisions regarding outdoor activities during varying air quality conditions.
